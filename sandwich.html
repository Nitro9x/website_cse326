<h1 class="heading">SANDWICH</h1>
<div class="box">
<h3 class="content">1.Toast your English muffin, for a little bit of crunch and some warm, toasty flavor.<br>
2.Spread good mayonnaise across the bottom bun for some creaminess and tanginess.<br>3.I recommend Sir Kensington’s brand.
Mash up some avocado in a bowl. The mash spreads easily over the remaining bun.<br>
4.Once your cheesy egg is ready, place it onto the mayo side. If and only if tomatoes are in season, add a slice of red tomato.<br>
5.Then add some red onion for some pungent flavor and crunch to contrast the soft egg. If you’re sensitive to onion flavor, rinse the sliced onions under cool running water to talk off some of the edge.<br>
6.Top the red onion with a couple splashes of hot sauce. I love Tabasco. The tangy acidity almost makes the onions taste pickled, and breaks through the rich, creamy flavor of the eggs and cheese.<br>
7.Arugula offers fresh, peppery flavor. Load it up!<br>
8.Finally, place the avocado bun on top, avocado side down. To slice, carefully slide a sharp, pointed knife into the center of the sandwich, and slice across to one edge. Repeat in the opposite direction. Serve warm.</h3>
